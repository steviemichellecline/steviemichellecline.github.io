	<h1>Which Two Websites Inspire Me?</h1

		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong><a href="http://www.borngroup.com">BORN Agency</a></strong></li>
				<li><strong><a href="pervolo.com">Pervolo IT Outsourcing</a></strong></li>
			</ul> 
		</p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?
		</h2>

		<p>
			These websites have an effective use of their individual backgrounds. They are not cluttered and both websites are easy to tell what they actually "do". Each website has balance to where they put their focal point. Each website also has an easy flow to it.

		

	<h2>What makes them similiar and different?</h1>

		<p>
			The Born website has a picture of a gorilla instead of heavy text. This gorilla helps symbolize what the agency believes about themselves. 

			Pervolo has a website that easily gets to the point. The negative space on the website makes it easy to read the positive space on the site. The hierarchy is also very user friendly.
